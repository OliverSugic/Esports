The page:
So were are going to make a quiz about Esports:
The Website is about Esports so it includes History, Player etc...
You can see also the lastest tournaments and who it won.
You also have some famous teams shown:

Web-Appplication:
Also we are going to make a quiz:
So you get a picture und you have to guess the to player or The team or whatever.




So we use Javascript, Html and boosttrap.
So we think that we can finsh the project at the end year.
We think that at the end will we will have good web-page and a working quiz.

A major risk is that we will not finish because we are slow
To minimze we are going to work a bit more so we can finish in time.

So we plan no Budget or money or anything else.

In Conclusion, we can do this projekt and we will finsish it.
